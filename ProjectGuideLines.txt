Angular PWA 

    A PWA only runs on https and localhost environment. The Angular CLI is limited because the service worker doesnâ€™t work with the ng serve command. You have to create a build and host it separately, perhaps using http-server

    1. ng add @angular/pwa@13.2.2

    2. angular.json file will be updated


    From

    "architect": {
    ...

    "assets": [
    "src/favicon.ico",
    "src/assets"
    ],
    ...

    }

    To

    "architect": {
    ...

    "assets": [
    "src/favicon.ico",
    "src/assets",
    "src/manifest.webmanifest"
    ],

    }



    will add 

    "serviceWorker": true,
    "ngswConfigPath": "ngsw-config.json"

    below 

    "scripts": [],

    From

    "test": {
    ...

    "assets": [
    "src/favicon.ico",
    "src/assets"
    ],
    ...

    }

    To

    "test": {
    ...

    "assets": [
    "src/favicon.ico",
    "src/assets",
    "src/manifest.webmanifest"
    ],

    }

    3. To see a PWA in action, follow the below steps.
    > ng build
    Open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/admin" in browser

    4. Awesome, you can see that a PWA is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/admin
    Now open the developer console and navigate to Application > Service Workers. 
    You can see there is a service worker file ngsw-worker.js installed for http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/admin
